RPG text game made in C++ - my first bigger project

My name is Grzegorz. I've been coding in C++ for three months. I'm going to become game developer.
It's my first big project. It's only text game, but I have to start with something.
This game is RPG. Fight system is based on fast typing. In the game, you can buy armor, weapons and develop your character.
